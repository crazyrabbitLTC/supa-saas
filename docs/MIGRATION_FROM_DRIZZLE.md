# Migration from Drizzle ORM to Supabase

This document details the process and considerations involved in migrating from Drizzle ORM to Supabase in this boilerplate project.

## Overview

The project was originally built with Drizzle ORM for database access, but has been migrated to use Supabase exclusively. This migration was completed to:

1. Standardize on a single backend platform (Supabase)
2. Simplify the architecture and reduce dependencies
3. Take advantage of Supabase's integrated features (auth, storage, realtime, etc.)
4. Prepare for future features like vector search with pgvector

## Migration Process

The migration was completed in four phases:

### Phase 1: Update Database Types and Service Layer

- Created parallel Supabase service implementations
- Defined type conversion utilities between snake_case and camelCase
- Ensured type compatibility between Drizzle and Supabase implementations

### Phase 2: Replace Drizzle with Supabase

- Switched API routes to use Supabase services
- Updated tests to work with Supabase
- Verified functionality with both implementations

### Phase 3: Remove Drizzle Dependencies

- Removed Drizzle schema definitions
- Deleted Drizzle migration files
- Removed Drizzle configuration
- Cleaned up package.json dependencies

### Phase 4: Testing and Validation

- Comprehensive testing of all database operations
- Verification of type safety
- Performance testing
- Documentation updates

## Key Changes

### Files Removed

- All Drizzle schema files
- Drizzle migration files
- Drizzle configuration files

### Files Updated

- Service implementations (renamed from `*ServiceSupabase.ts` to `*Service.ts`)
- Test files to use Supabase
- Documentation to reflect Supabase usage
- Package dependencies

### Architecture Changes

#### Before:

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│   Service   │────▶│    Drizzle  │────▶│  PostgreSQL │
│    Layer    │     │     ORM     │     │  Database   │
└─────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘
```

#### After:

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│   Service   │────▶│   Supabase  │────▶│  PostgreSQL │
│    Layer    │     │    Client   │     │  Database   │
└─────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘
```

## Type System Changes

### Before (Drizzle):

- Drizzle schema definitions generated TypeScript types
- Types were camelCase by default
- Manual type definitions for some operations

### After (Supabase):

- Types defined manually based on database schema
- Conversion between snake_case (database) and camelCase (application)
- More explicit type definitions for all operations

## Lessons Learned

1. **Type Conversion**: The biggest challenge was handling the conversion between snake_case and camelCase consistently
2. **Testing Strategy**: Having comprehensive tests made the migration much easier to validate
3. **Service Abstraction**: The service layer abstraction made it possible to swap implementations with minimal changes to consuming code
4. **Documentation**: Keeping documentation updated throughout the process was essential

## Future Considerations

With the migration complete, the project is now positioned to:

1. Implement vector search using Supabase's pgvector support
2. Take advantage of Supabase's realtime features
3. Integrate with Supabase storage
4. Use Supabase edge functions for serverless operations
