# Security Implementation Plan

## Overview

This plan addresses the key improvement areas identified in the security code review. The implementation is organized into three phases, prioritizing critical security enhancements first, followed by error handling improvements and architectural refinements.

## Phase 1: Critical Security Enhancements (Estimated: 2-3 days)

### 1. CSRF Protection Enhancement
- [ ] 1.1. Update CSRF token storage to use `httpOnly` cookies
- [ ] 1.2. Implement `secure` and `sameSite=strict` attributes for all security cookies
- [ ] 1.3. Add server-side CSRF token generation in API routes
- [ ] 1.4. Implement token validation middleware for all POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE requests
- [ ] 1.5. Add CSRF token rotation after login and critical actions
- [ ] 1.6. Create unit tests for CSRF protection

### 2. Cookie Security Configuration
- [ ] 2.1. Audit all cookie usage in the application
- [ ] 2.2. Create a centralized cookie management utility
- [ ] 2.3. Standardize cookie security attributes (httpOnly, secure, sameSite)
- [ ] 2.4. Implement reasonable expiration times for different cookie types
- [ ] 2.5. Add cookie prefixing for extra security (`__Host-` or `__Secure-`)

### 3. Server-Side Rate Limiting
- [ ] 3.1. Select and install a rate-limiting package (e.g., `express-rate-limit` or equivalent)
- [ ] 3.2. Implement rate limiting for authentication endpoints (login, signup, password reset)
- [ ] 3.3. Add tiered rate limiting for API endpoints (different limits for different endpoint sensitivity)
- [ ] 3.4. Create configurable limits based on environment (dev/staging/prod)
- [ ] 3.5. Add logging for rate limit events

## Phase 2: Error Handling & Middleware Improvements (Estimated: 2-3 days)

### 4. Error Handling Specificity
- [ ] 4.1. Create custom error classes for different error types
- [ ] 4.2. Implement specific error codes for authentication failures
- [ ] 4.3. Update middleware to provide detailed error information (safe for exposure)
- [ ] 4.4. Create error mapping between internal and external error formats
- [ ] 4.5. Add consistent error logging across the application

### 5. Middleware Error Resilience
- [ ] 5.1. Add try/catch blocks for all cookie operations
- [ ] 5.2. Implement graceful fallbacks for missing or invalid tokens
- [ ] 5.3. Add context checking before using `cookies()` API
- [ ] 5.4. Implement proper handling of edge cases (expired sessions, etc.)
- [ ] 5.5. Test middleware with various failure scenarios

## Phase 3: Code Organization and Architecture (Estimated: 3-4 days)

### 6. Code Organization and Duplication
- [ ] 6.1. Create utility functions for common permission checks
- [ ] 6.2. Refactor duplicated error handling code
- [ ] 6.3. Centralize authentication logic in a dedicated service
- [ ] 6.4. Implement dependency injection for better testability
- [ ] 6.5. Document the authentication flow and security practices

### 7. Documentation and Testing
- [ ] 7.1. Create comprehensive tests for authentication flows
- [ ] 7.2. Document security features for future developers
- [ ] 7.3. Create a security checklist for future changes
- [ ] 7.4. Perform a final security review of the implementation

## Dependencies and Prerequisites

1. `@supabase/ssr` package must be properly installed and configured
2. The Next.js middleware must be functioning correctly
3. Development environment must be set up to test security features

## Success Criteria

1. All security cookies are properly configured with httpOnly, secure, and sameSite attributes
2. CSRF protection functions correctly for all sensitive operations
3. Rate limiting prevents excessive authentication attempts
4. Error messages are specific and helpful without exposing sensitive information
5. All middleware functions gracefully handle edge cases
6. Code duplication is minimized, and common functionality is properly abstracted

## Implementation Notes

### Code Review Findings

The code review identified several areas for improvement in our authentication system:

1. **CSRF Protection**: Current implementation doesn't use httpOnly cookies for token storage, making it vulnerable to XSS attacks.

2. **Error Handling**: Error messages are too generic and don't provide enough information to distinguish between different types of authentication failures.

3. **Middleware Stability**: Issues with cookie handling and request contexts in middleware could lead to intermittent authentication failures.

4. **Cookie Security**: Security attributes for cookies need to be standardized and enforced.

5. **Rate Limiting**: Client-side rate limiting can be bypassed - server-side implementation needed.

6. **Code Organization**: Duplicated code in permission checks and authentication logic should be refactored.

By addressing these issues, we will significantly improve the security posture of our application while enhancing maintainability and error resilience.
