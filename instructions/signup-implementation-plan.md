- [x] Connect login form submission to the authentication service

### Session Management

- [x] Add authentication state listener
- [x] Create a useAuth hook for accessing auth state
- [x] Update UI components based on authentication state

### Protected Routes
- [x] Create a ProtectedRoute component wrapper

- [ ] Create loading state during team creation

### Testing
- [ ] Test signup with valid credentials
- [ ] Test login with valid credentials
- [ ] Test validation error handling
- [ ] Test server error handling
- [ ] Test post-authentication navigation
- [ ] Test protected routes redirect
- [ ] Test session persistence

### Cleanup & Documentation
- [ ] Clean up any console logs
- [ ] Add comments for complex logic
- [x] Update README with new authentication flow details
- [ ] Document known edge cases or issues

## Implementation Details

### Sign-up Form Component Requirements
1. Collect first name, last name, email, password, and password confirmation
2. Validate all fields before submission
3. Prevent multiple submissions
4. Display appropriate error messages
5. Redirect to dashboard upon successful signup

### Login Form Component Requirements
1. Collect email and password
2. Validate fields before submission
3. Prevent multiple submissions
4. Display appropriate error messages
5. Redirect to dashboard upon successful login

### Authentication Service Responsibilities
1. Handle communication with Supabase Auth API
2. Manage user session data
3. Provide error handling for auth-related operations
4. Support sign-up and login with email/password (required)
5. Support social authentication (optional)

### Auth Provider Responsibilities
1. Track authentication state (isAuthenticated, isLoading)
2. Provide user information to components
3. Listen for authentication state changes
4. Expose login/logout functionality
5. Handle session refreshing

### Protected Routes
1. Check authentication status
2. Redirect to login if not authenticated
3. Show loading state while checking
4. Render protected content only when authenticated
5. Support customizable redirect locations

### Security Considerations
1. Ensure password strength requirements
2. Implement CSRF protection
3. Secure storage of authentication tokens
4. Proper error message sanitization
5. Prevent session hijacking
6. Protect sensitive routes with authentication checks
